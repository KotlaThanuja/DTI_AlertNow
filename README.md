# DTI_AlertNow

This project aims to develop an Emergency Response App that allows victims of accidents to be quickly and accurately identified by their family members or emergency responders.
The website  includes a fingerprint scanning function and an intermediary person to connect callers to emergency responders without disclosing the privacy of the victim by facilitating rapid and accurate victim identification and communication, the app aims to reduce preventable deaths due to accidents. 

Try with the vehicle numbers - 0000, 0001, 0002, 0003 - These are the sample vehicle numbers for which the website works
